# CS 330 Final Project: Routing

## Thomas Matlak and Thanh Nguyen

### To Run
`python3 dijkstra_routing.py [graph file]`

Prints the routing tables for each vertex in the input file.

If no graph is provided, the `default_graph.txt` file is used.

Graph input files take the form:

`V` the number of vertices

`E` the number of edges

`v1 v2` the undirected edges, each edge on a new line
